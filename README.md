## Is this game open-source?

It is moreso [source-available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software), rather than traditionally open-source. Consequently, [not having a license](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository#choosing-the-right-license) means by default, I still reserve all the original rights for the game's assets.

Fear not though, I'm A-okay with whatever you wanna do with the source-code! Please feel to free to [look](src/assets/world/are-you-data-mining.png), reuse, fork, or mod the game! as long as it's non-commercial.

## Import, Run, and Export

Everything is included in the [src](src/) directory/folder.

WIP.
